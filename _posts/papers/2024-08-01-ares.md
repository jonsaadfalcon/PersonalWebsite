Many information retrieval tasks require large labeled datasets for fine-tuning. 
However, such datasets are often unavailable, and their utility for real-world 
applications can diminish quickly due to domain shifts. To address this challenge, 
we develop and motivate a method for using large language models (LLMs) to generate 
large numbers of synthetic queries cheaply. The method begins by generating a small 
number of synthetic queries using an expensive LLM. After that, a much less expensive 
one is used to create large numbers of synthetic queries, which are used to fine-tune 
a family of reranker models. These rerankers are then distilled into a single efficient 
retriever for use in the target domain. We show that this technique boosts zero-shot 
accuracy in long-tail domains and achieves substantially lower latency than standard reranking methods.
